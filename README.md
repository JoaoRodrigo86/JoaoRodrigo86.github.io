## Portfolio Website for João Rodrigo Carvalho

João is a portuguese graphics designer and illustrator, the creator of [Hallo](https://joaorodrigocarvalho.github.io/projetos/hallo).

The standout feature of the website is the color picker in the homepage. By default, it's set to a yellow, but as you slide it you'll see that backgrounds and icons that used that color are changing. This affects all pages in the website.

It was made to be responsive, with elements changing size, position, color and functionality depending on screen size; and icons will automatically adapt so you won't see two black icons next to eachother.

###### This website was programmed by Flávio Ferreira and was part of the trade of services between the programmer and designer, João designed [my website](https://ldkid.github.io/) and I programmed his.
